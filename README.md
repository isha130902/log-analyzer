A simple Python tool to scan log files and detect users with multiple failed login attempts.

- Tracks failed login attempts
- Flags users with 3 or more failed logins
- Saves suspicious users to `report.txt`

##  Technologies Used

- Basic file handling
- `collections` module

##  Files
- `log_analyzer.py` – main script
- `logfile.txt` – sample log input
- `report.txt` –  generated report
